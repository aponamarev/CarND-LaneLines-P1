**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

** Reflection **

**1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.**

My pipeline includes 4 steps for preprocessing the image and and six steps to calculate the lanes. Preprocessing steps are designed to transform an input image into a binary mask that shows the lanes as a positive pixels (colored in red) and the background as zeros. Preprocessing includes the following steps:
1. Convert an input image into a greyscale image
2. Normalize resulting image
3. Transform a normalized image into edges with Canny filter
4. Apply a mask to eliminate a signal in the parts of the image that are unlikely to contain lanes

The lane identification includes the following steps:
1. Identification of lines with cv2.HoughLinesP method
2. Filtering out lines as a possible candidates for lanes
3. Picking right and left lanes
4. Resize lines using the highest identified point
5. Store found lines in a frame buffer through right_lane_buffer setter
6. Recalculate the mean lane prediction through right_lane_buffer and left_lane_buffer getter function

All of these steps are wrapped into a simplified interface of provide_img_with_lanes method of a class named Lane.

**2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline**


One shortcoming of the current approach is low recall of lane marks located further away. As a result, the algorithm produces unstable estimates of the straight lane. Another shortcoming of this method is a poor performance of Canny filter on a low contrast images. As a result the algorithm can lose the lane tracking, which you can observer in the results of "challenge.mp4". The third drawback of this approach is many false positive candidate lines generated by Hough algorithm.

**3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline**

A possible improvement would be to train a small convolutional neural network to localize lanes with a greater precision. Due to potential high capacity of even a very simple neural net, it is possible to train the net to perform well on cases proved to be difficult for Canny/Hough pipeline.
